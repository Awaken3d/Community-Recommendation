/*
 * For each zip code, the score equals to:
 * score = rcoe * Part1 + ncoe * Part2
 * Part1 is related to rating and part2 is related to the number of restaurants in this area.
 * And rcoe and ncoe are coefficient, I temporarily define them to 0.7 and 0.3 respectively, 
 * since rating is supposed to have higher weight.
 * part1 = averageRating + variance * coe, coe is temporarily defined to 0.1
 * Because Part1's range is [0, 5], I also divide Part2 to [0, 5].
 * Find the max number and min number of restaurants in all areas, and divide the range to 6 part.
 * So [minSize, maxSize] => [0, 5]
